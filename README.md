# RideWay Frontend

This package contains the React + TypeScript + Vite frontend for the RideWay bus booking platform.

For a full overview of the UI, pages, and features, see **README-RIDEWAY.md** in this folder. That document is the main guide for working on the RideWay frontend.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd bus-booking-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:5173` and expects the backend API on `http://localhost:4000/api` by default (configurable via `VITE_API_URL`).
